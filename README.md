## ü§î About

Help102 is a dedicated online platform specifically designed for the ENGR102 (Introduction to Python) course at Texas A&M University. Our primary goal is to streamline access to course resources while simplifying complex materials, enabling students to excel in their studies and grasp Python concepts more effectively. At help102, we prioritize the creation of engaging and concise videos along with interactive content to enhance the learning experience for all students. Moreover, our platform is committed to ensuring a seamless user experience for TAs and PTs through an effortless onboarding process and an integrated content management system tailored for both videos and static educational material.

If you're interested in learning about our development and design process, you can go to my dev log and search for articles with the 'help102' tag (once I'm done writing them lol).

## üéà Usage

**For Students**

To access all resources, simply visit our [website](https://help102.vercel.app/). If you're ready to begin learning, head to the '/learn' route where you'll find a collection of videos, articles, and interactive resources. Additionally, our '/review' route is dedicated to specific topic reviews, quizzes, and exams. If you have a specific question that help102 doesn't cover, feel free to join the TAO Discord and ask one of the TAs. Similarly, for any technical issues with setup or encountering unusual error messages, it's best to ask a TA or to post a question in the TAO Discord chat. The content itself is designed to skip a lot of unncessary baggage, so I would recommend going through all the lessons on the '/learn' page. I also heavily recommend using the review section to study for exams since the normal lectures don't really go over exam strategies or allow for sufficient practice. 

As a side note, while help102 simplifies the content and studying process, it's not a cheat code you can use the day before your exam (or maybe it is idk). For both your physical and mental health, I heavily recommend maintaining a good study habit along with using help102 for the best results. Once again, pulling an all nighter the day before your exam is **NOT** ideal (although I know a lot of you fuckers will do it anyways).

**For TAs/PTs**

If you're interested in contributing or making educational content, go to the help102 website and login with your TAMU email. Then, join the [TAO Discord](https://tx.ag/216server) if you haven't already. Afterwards, contact me via one of the contact methods [below](https://github.com/WarrenWu4/help102?tab=readme-ov-file#contact) and I'll give you TA perms (and maybe a special character if I like you üôÇ). Unfortunately, I don't have access to the list of TAs, so I'll have to manually check that you're legit which might take some time since I'm always busy üò≠. Otherwise, once you have TA perms, make sure not to upload anything weird (that's literally the only rule, so don't fuck it up).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues

If you find a bug, typo, security threat, or literally any other issue/suggestion submit an issue [here](https://github.com/WarrenWu4/help102/issues/new).
