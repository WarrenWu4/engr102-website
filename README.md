Yo wassup, this is the help102 repo that stores the source code for the help102 site. Go ahead and read this article for a brief overview about the details of this project. Otherwise feel free to directly go to the website and explore.

### Purpose

At Texas A&M (TAMU), there's a universally hated process called Entry-To-A-Major (ETAM) where freshmen engineers have to reapply to their desired major after completing a list of required courses. For a lot of people ETAM is incredibly stressful (😩) since it's nearly impossible to be accepted into a very competitive major without being auto-admited (<=3.75 GPA). While I obviously didn't face those struggles 😏, I wanted to help alleviate the stress for my fellow Aggies in at least one area. I'm not super great at chemistry or physics, so I decided to make a website to help people with the ENGR102 course (intro to Python). Another goal of this project is to inspire other developers out there to make something similar for other courses. I'm sure that there are many talented individuals at TAMU that are way better web developers than me, so I hope that this will be the start of many similar websites that will eventually lead to an overall more stress-free college environment.

### Content

**If You're a Student**

The content (made by me at least) is designed to skip a lot of unncessary baggage, so I would recommend going through all the lessons in the learn page. I also heavily recommend using the review section to study for exams since the normal lessons don't really go over exam strategies or allow for sufficient practice. While help102 simplifies the content and studying process, it's not a cheat code you can use the day before your exam (or maybe it is idk). For both your physical and mental health, I heavily recommend maintaining a good study habit along with using help102 for the best results. Once again, pulling an all nighter the day before your exam is **NOT** ideal (although I know a lot of you fuckers will do it anyways).

**If You're a TA/PT**

If you're a TA/PT and want to be registered on the help102 site, first go to the help102 website and login. Then, join the [TAO Discord](https://tx.ag/216server) if you haven't already. From there you can just ping me @warrenwu and I'll get you setup from there. If you don't wanna download Discord for some reason, find another way to contact me (socials down below) and I'll give you TA perms (and maybe a special character if I like you 🙂). Unfortunately, I don't have access to the list of TAs, so I'll have to manually check that you're legit which might take some time since I'm always busy 😭. Otherwise, once you have TA perms, make sure not to upload anything weird (that's literally the only rule, so don't fuck it up).

### Contributing

If you find a bug, typo, security threat, or literally any other issue/suggestion please contact me through Discord @warrenwu or through any of the other socials down below and I'll fix it whenever I have time. If you want to actually improve the project, please contact me and I'll add you as a contributor. I'll also send you the Firebase API keys so you can access the backend when developing.

1. To start, clone the repo (and a star would be appreciated 😊).

```
git clone https://github.com/WarrenWu4/help102.git
```

2. cd into the project and install the necessary packages

```
cd help102

npm install
```

3. Make sure to move the .env.local file (that I sent you) into the project

4. Run the program and start a local server

```
npm run dev
```

5. Make **good** changes and push it

happy coding!
